There has been considerable confusion in the market on terminology around this segment. This paper attempts to clarify the basics of Content Management system structure and function, and the extensions and implications of Enterprise Content Management. This includes a discussion on web site content management, and a discussion of the importance of federation and warehousing as it relates to Content Management and unstructured data. The overview is provided in a vendor neutral manner, without references to specific commercially available systems."}
