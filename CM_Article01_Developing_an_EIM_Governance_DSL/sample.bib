In light of the growing appetite for resources and service levels on par with user expectations, multi-cloud scenarios are becoming the next frontier in the usage of distributed datacenters for private and hybrid Cloud scenarios.

Especially so when considered jointly with orchestration services; indeed OpenStack, as the most widely adopted Cloud middleware among the OpenSource community, features an orchestration subsystem, and may orchestrate the deployment of applications and services. In this work the authors will describe an architecture, developed within the H2020 BEACON project, for a standardized approach to orchestrated application deployment in multi-Cloud OpenStack- based setups, with TOSCA providing the specifications.},

	abstract  = {For over forty years, relational databases have been the leading model for data storage, retrieval and management. However, due to increasing needs for scalability and performance, alternative systems have emerged, namely NewSQL technology. NewSQL is a class of modern relational database management systems (RDBMS) that provide the same scalable performance of NoSQL systems for online transaction processing (OLTP) read-write workloads while still maintaining the ACID guarantees of a traditional database system. The rising interest in NewSQL technology, over the last few years resulted in an increasing number of evaluations and comparisons among competing NewSQL technologies. Some of the NewSQL databases currently used in various popular web applications are VoltDB, Google Spanner, MemSQL, SAP HANA, NuoDB, and TokuDB. This work is trying to comment on the various NewSQL database systems which describes benefits, characteristics, and classification of NewSQL databases for online transaction processing (OLTP) for Big data management. It also provides the list of popular NewSQL databases in categorized tables. This dissertation work mainly covers evaluation comparison between four NewSQL databases: NuoDB, VoltDB, MemSQL, and Cockroach DB on the basis of various parameters like read latency, write latency, update latency, and execution time. The experiments do not cover only performance (latency and execution time) but also focus on ease of use and flexibility of the used NewSQL databases.},

	abstract = {Today, most of the organizations trust on their age old legacy applications, to support their business-critical systems. However, there are several critical concerns, as maintainability and scalability issues, associated with the legacy system. In this background, cloud services offer a more agile and cost effective platform, to support business applications and IT infrastructure. As the adoption of cloud services has been increasing recently and so has been the academic research in cloud migration. However, there is a genuine need of secondary study to further strengthen this research. The primary objective of this paper is to scientifically and systematically identify, categorize and compare the existing research work in the area of legacy to cloud migration. The paper has also endeavored to consolidate the research on Security issues, which is prime factor hindering the adoption of cloud through classifying the studies on secure cloud migration. SLR (Systematic Literature Review) of thirty selected papers, published from 2009 to 2014 was conducted to properly understand the nuances of the security framework. To categorize the selected studies, authors have proposed a conceptual model for cloud migration which has resulted in a resource base of existing solutions for cloud migration. This study concludes that cloud migration research is in seminal stage but simultaneously it is also evolving and maturing, with increasing participation from academics and industry alike. The paper also identifies the need for a secure migration model, which can fortify organization's trust into cloud migration and facilitate necessary tool support to automate the migration process.},

Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) can benefit a lot from software services that are managed in a professional way. Cloud computing enables them to overcome restrictions from low budgets and limited resources for ICT. However, cloud adoption is challenging and requires a clear cloud roadmap. Organisations lack knowledge of cloud computing and are usually challenged by the adoption of cloud services. In most cases, SMEs do not know what aspects they have to take into consideration for a sound decision in favour or against the cloud. A cloud readiness assessment is a general approach to facilitate this decision-making process. The presented study focuses on the development of an assessment framework for cloud services (SaaS) in the domain of enterprise content management (ECM) and social software (e-collaboration).},
