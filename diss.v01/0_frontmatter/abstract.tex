 The ‘Cloud’ or to be more precise cloud computing has become a synonym for “faster, flexible, scalable and last but not least cost efficient”. Many decision makers in mayor Enterprises are mandating the restructuring of their IT-Environment such to cut cost and increase productivity. For the latter, cloud implies the industrialization of delivery of content services which means “employing a new consumption model inspired by the consumer internet services. In this market place one business is offering a managed service to the other business, thus building a food chain for the B-B eco system. Cloud aims at: a) exploiting the economies-of-scale derived from an inherent massive multi-tenant environment, b) the ubiquity of the service and c) an increasing secure and trusted trading environment. In B-B the expectation is of an enterprise ready, replicable standard SaaS offering where costs are reduced to the actual consumption i.e. pay per use business model and security and privacy are guaranteed. Resource topology optimization is a mandatory capability for cloud systems.
